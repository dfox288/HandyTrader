# Handy Trader

A Fabric mod for Minecraft 26.1.x that lets you bookmark favorite villager trades.

Star the trades you use most and they sort to the top of the list automatically — perfect for big trading halls where you only use 2 out of 10 master trades per villager.

## Features

- **Bookmark favorites** — Click the top-left corner of any trade row to mark it with a gold bookmark indicator.
- **Sort to top** — Favorited trades automatically move to the top of the trade list.
- **Per-villager storage** — Each villager remembers its own favorites, persisted across sessions.
- **Hover feedback** — Ghost bookmark appears when hovering the corner; brightens on favorited rows.
- **Sound feedback** — Subtle amethyst chime when toggling favorites.
- **Configurable** — Toggle favorites on/off via config screen or JSON file.

## Requirements

- Minecraft Java Edition 26.1.x
- [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/) 0.19.2+
- [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) matching your Minecraft version

### Optional (for config screen)

- [ModMenu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) — adds a Configure button in the mod list
- [YACL](https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl) — powers the in-game config screen

Without these, everything works with sensible defaults. You can also edit `config/handytraders.json` manually.
